The Lisp Game world is small enough to enumerate and investigate manually. Maybe there is a way to automatically merge similar lisp libraries?

The line between game engine, game, app and tutorial is often blurred.

How to organize Lisp game related stuff?
By separating repos into categories?
By tagging repos with tags?
By tagging individual files and directories of repos?
By tagging lisp objects? 

What is the point of this? So cross-pollination can occur among Common Lisp game engines.
